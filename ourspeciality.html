        <h2>#1: Engaging Quizzes for Testing Understanding</h2>
        <p>We have frequent checkpoints in the form of Kahoot/Slido Quizzes not just to allow students to check on their understanding,  but also to allow them to rest and recharge while competing with their friends and other students.<br> The questions are based on the class' content and are also a way for us to adjust the workshop and focus on weaker topics should there be questions that the class does not do well in. </p>

        <h2>#2: Engaging Materials for Greater Absorption of Information</h2>
        <p>We have an engaging deck of slides specially curated for each lesson based on the age group and contents taught. <br><br> Filled with visuals, polls, and interactions with students, we ensure that every student is understanding and not lost should they not understand a concept.</p>
