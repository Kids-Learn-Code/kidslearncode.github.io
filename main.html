    <h1>Kids Learn Code</h1>
    <p>Kids Learn Code is a non-profit Ground-Up Initiative specializing in providing free coding education to students aged 7-12. We aim to engage and ignite kidsâ€™ passion for coding in an evolving world, and we envision a world where every child has access to quality coding education.</p>

    <h2>Skills Developed</h2>
    <p>Kids Learn Code's workshops are meticulously designed to complement our distinctive CODE framework. Beyond acquiring coding skills, students engage in a holistic learning experience where they cultivate essential interpersonal skills vital for success in diverse life endeavors.</p>

    <h3>Confidence</h3>
    <p>Students are taught how to make slides and present them in our workshops. This allows them to gain confidence in their future projects.</p>

    <h3>Originality</h3>
    <p>Originality is crucial in the hackathon segment. Students are encouraged to come up with new ideas using the problem statement.</p>

    <h3>Digital Literacy</h3>
    <p>Digital Literacy is a new addition to the framework. Students are taught how to stay safe and also code better with Computational Thinking.</p>

    <h3>Engagement</h3>
    <p>Engagement is crucial for students to absorb knowledge. With quizzes and hackathons, students stay focused and satisfied during workshops!</p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    <h3>June 2022</h3>
    <p>Idea for Kids Learn Code launched. Planning started and curation of materials was carried out.</p>

    <h3>November 2022</h3>

    <h3>September 2023</h3>
    <p>Introduction of new add-ons to course content, including a Computational Thinking course segment to teach students how to think like a computer.</p>

    <h3>November 2023</h3>
    <p>Conducted a 2nd Online Virtual Workshop, this time on Python, with students from more than 3 different countries joining us!</p>
